# Linear Regression - Least Squares  


## Project Overview
----------

The objective of this excercise is to create a number of functions that will eventually be able to read in raw data to `Pandas` and perform a least squares regression on a subset of that data.  

This will include:  
- Calculating least squares weights
- reading data on dist to return `Pandas` DataFrame  
- select data by column  
- implement column cutoffs  

** Motivation**: Least squares regression offer a way to build a closed-form and interpretable model.  

**Problem**: Using housing data, we will attempt to predict house price using living area with a regression model.  

**Data**: Our data today comes from [Kaggle's House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).  

See above link for Description of data from `Kaggle`.
